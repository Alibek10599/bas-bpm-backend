# BAS BPM Backend Performance Testing

## Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the performance and stress testing implementation for the BAS BPM Backend. The implementation uses Artillery, a modern, powerful load testing toolkit, to simulate realistic user behavior and evaluate system performance under various load conditions.

## What Has Been Implemented

1. **Comprehensive Load Test Configuration**
   - A main configuration file (`performance-tests/load-test.yml`) 
   - Realistic test scenarios for all major services
   - Different load phases to simulate various traffic patterns
   - Custom JavaScript functions for dynamic test data generation

2. **Service-Specific Test Scenarios**
   - Auth Service: Login, user profile retrieval
   - Users Management: User listing and creation
   - Tasks Service: Complete CRUD operations with status transitions
   - Reservations Service: Full lifecycle testing (create, read, update, delete)
   - File Management: File creation and retrieval
   - References: Data querying
   - Notifications: Status checking

3. **Infrastructure and Documentation**
   - Detailed README with testing methodology and instructions
   - Custom processor.js with helper functions
   - Reports directory structure
   - Installation script for required dependencies

## How It Addresses Performance Testing Needs

The implementation addresses key performance testing requirements by:

1. **Testing All Critical Services**: Every major microservice in the application is covered with specific test scenarios, ensuring comprehensive testing of the entire system.

2. **Simulating Realistic User Behavior**: Rather than testing individual endpoints in isolation, the scenarios mimic actual user workflows, providing more meaningful performance insights.

3. **Progressive Load Testing**: The configuration includes warm-up, ramp-up, sustained load, spike, and scale-down phases to identify performance characteristics under different conditions.

4. **Metrics Collection**: Detailed metrics are gathered for response times, throughput, error rates, and per-endpoint performance to pinpoint bottlenecks.

5. **Bilingual Documentation**: Documentation is provided in both English and Russian, ensuring accessibility for all team members.

## Key Features of the Testing Approach

1. **Weighted Traffic Distribution**: Test traffic is distributed across services based on expected production usage patterns, with 25% for Tasks, 20% for Auth, 15% each for Reservations and File Management, and smaller weights for other services.

2. **Authentication Flow Integration**: All test scenarios properly authenticate before performing operations, accurately reflecting real-world security constraints.

3. **Dynamic Test Data**: Custom JavaScript functions generate unique usernames, realistic timestamps, and test content to prevent test data collisions and caching effects.

4. **Detailed Success Criteria**: Each request includes specific expectations for status codes, response times, and content types to ensure proper validation.

5. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Test results are saved in both human-readable and JSON formats for both quick review and detailed analysis.

## Getting Started

To begin performance testing:

1. **Install Required Dependencies**:
   ```
   ./install-performance-deps.sh
   ```

2. **Configure Test Parameters**:
   - Update test credentials in `performance-tests/load-test.yml`
   - Adjust target URLs if needed
   - Modify load phases based on your environment's capacity

3. **Run the Tests**:
   ```
   pnpm run test:performance
   ```

4. **Review Results**:
   - Text report: `performance-tests/reports/report.txt`
   - JSON data: `performance-tests/reports/report.json`

## Recommended Next Steps

To further enhance the performance testing capabilities:

1. **Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate performance testing as part of your CI/CD workflow to catch performance regressions early.

2. **Create Performance Dashboards**: Develop visualization dashboards using tools like Grafana to track performance metrics over time.

3. **Set Performance Budgets**: Establish maximum acceptable response times and error rates for critical endpoints, with alerts when they're exceeded.

4. **Expand Test Scenarios**: Add more complex workflows that span multiple services to test system integration points.

5. **Implement Distributed Testing**: For high-load scenarios, distribute test execution across multiple machines to generate higher traffic volumes.

6. **Environment-Specific Configurations**: Create separate configuration files for different environments (development, staging, production-like).

7. **Correlate with APM Data**: Use Application Performance Monitoring tools alongside load tests to gain deeper insights into system behavior under load.

## Conclusion

The implemented performance testing solution provides a solid foundation for evaluating and monitoring the BAS BPM Backend's performance characteristics. By regularly running these tests and analyzing the results, the team can identify potential bottlenecks early, validate performance improvements, and ensure the system meets its scalability requirements.
